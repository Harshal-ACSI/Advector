# Advector

Advector is a programme that uses github to store and git to tranfer apps from a github server to the client's computer. This frees up the clients disk space. Through this, people with lesser disk space on their computer will be able to still access multiple apps.

### Example:

For example, Blender can be imported using the `port` command. The changes made on Blender will still be saved and will be transfered to the github repository. Take a look at this [video](Advector 2024-12-03 17-48-18.mp4)
